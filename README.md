# Kine

What you will see when you first open the program are two things:

* Little green-to-red circles, that are **worms**.
* The map behind them, which is represented in grayscale,
  with **black** being **absence of food**, and **white** as
  **plenty of food**.

There, you will see that even with an extremely simple algorithm,
is actually capable of "preferring" an environment with lots of
food, and "hating" environment with little to no food.

Pressing Function keys will cause the map to regenerate as:

* **F1**: split into half.
* **F2**: smooth Perlin noise.
* **F3**: vertical gradient.
* **F4**: sharp circle.
* **F5**: Voronoi/Cellular noise.
* other functions keys: same as **F1**.

Yes, I know the code sucks.
